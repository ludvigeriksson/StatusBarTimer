#StatusBarTimer 
by Ludvig Eriksson

StatusBarTimer is a jailbreak tweak that displays the timer next to the clock in the status bar. As of version 1.2.0, StatusBarTimer now also can show the stopwatch. You can choose to enable and disable the tweak for these separately in the settings.

Choose a separator in the settings. Default is a dash '-'.

StatusBarTimer is available for free from [BigBoss](http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=statusbartimerDp).
